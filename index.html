The attack by Russian forces has resulted in the destruction of the infrastructure of Ukrainian cities, including universities, research centers, and educational institutions. Millions of people, including educators and scientists, have been displaced from their homes, and their future is uncertain. This conflict is unfolding in a country with a large and diverse scientific community and a rich history of higher education and scientific research. The global research community has provided an effective and timely response by offering research opportunities and fellowships for displaced Ukrainian academic faculty and students. However, many of these opportunities were primarily targeted at individuals capable of leaving the country.  <b><u>Many Ukrainian scholars remaining in the country urgently need short- or long-term employment.</u></b></p>
   <p>There are increased challenges for Ukrainian scientists and students due to <u>lack of skills necessary to find a job in science outside the country</u>, and due to needing additional training and education to ensure they have adequate skills to perform the job to be competitive for the multitude of the positions offered by the global scientific community. </p>
   <p>We formed an interdisciplinary group (<b><u>“Bioinformatics for Ukraine”</u></b>) consisting of leading researchers from multiple countries, including the United States, Ukraine, Austria, Netherlands, Latvia, and Poland to develop a <b><u>strategy to empower scholars scholars at-risk in Ukraine with state-of-the-art skills in bioinformatics:</u></b></p>
   <ul><li>The strategy is described in detail in our recent preprint Chhugani, Karishma, et al. <a href="https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/vkp5q">"Effective and feasible mechanisms to support Ukrainian researchers and students at risk: opportunities, challenges and pitfalls." (2022)</a> </li><li>The manuscript describing the strategy is under review in Science.<p></ul></li>
